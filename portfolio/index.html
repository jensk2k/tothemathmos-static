            <a href="/portfolio/kogama/"><image src="/images/gameicons/kogama_icon2.png" alt="KoGaMa" /></a>
            <p>This project was made as a DADIU competence project in October 2011. The project was made for the Multiverse Aps. game <a href="http://kogama.com/">KoGaMa</a>. This is a demo on how to procedurally generate floating islands with simplex noise and then smoothing their surfaces within the limitations of the geometrical constraints in KoGaMa. Ultimately this is intended to be used to populate new worlds in KoGaMa. </p>
