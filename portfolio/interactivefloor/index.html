title: Interactive Floor
---
<p>In this project I developed the software for an interactive floor for the danish regional libraries. </p>
<p>I developed an engine for content production, that could calculate the position of the player on the floor, as well as a game.</p>
<h2>How does it work</h2>
<p>A projector projects the graphics onto the floor and the a Kinect sensor mounted in the ceiling is used to determine the position of the player. </p>

<p>The position of the player is calculated by finding the closest position to the Kinect sensor in 3D, which is the head of the player, then projecting that point orthogonally to the floor. </p>
<h2>Results</h2>
