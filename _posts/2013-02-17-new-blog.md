<p>This blog used to be hosted on my Raspberry Pi which I recently bricked, so the site has been offline for some months. But I finally got it up again, now running using jekyll and github pages which are both awesome! </p>
<p>The old posts are gone for now, but I expect posting a lot of new stuff in the near future. Particularly a bunch of useful geometry processing scripts for Unity that I have been developing with my thesis plus the thesis itself, which is about a new system for generating and simulating destructible object in Unity.</p>
